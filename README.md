Sandbox for Ajax and JSON projects written in Vanilla.js

With a single div with `id="people"` in `index.html`, the `js/script.js` file pulls information from `assets/json/people.json` and populates the webpage with user profiles, pictures, and links.

Since `js/script.js` was written in Vanilla.js (i.e., plain old javascript, no frameworks), it is lightweight and has a high level of backwards compatibility with older browsers. Small library files for the fetch function and support for promises were added to allow for compatibility on older iPads and in all IE browsers.

CSS was purposely left to a minimum, using barebones Foundation for some structure. This allows for more flexibility for later customization.
